# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
Because python was the first programming language I learned how to use it is oddly nostalgic. Also it is weird going from Java to python the habits just don't match. However python is very convienient with the way it is operated andthe functional use of shortcuts. 

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
It is similar in the way that the language is logical and uses variables however the syntax is just slightly different and there are more short cuts in python

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I learned ho to solve certain logic problems as well as refamiliarizing myself with python. I learned the many shortcuts available in python.
